### Bugs

### Small Changes

-   [ ] Change function definitions because void types exist

### Features

-   [ ] Allow objects to be created with "new" (and update semantics to include this)
-   [ ] Add increment and decrement operators
-   [ ] Add tertiary operator
-   [ ] Bitwise Binary Operators
-   [ ] Allow larger and smaller integers and floats
-   [ ] Allow multi-assignments in variable assigning
-   [ ] Allow entering mutliple expressions into a 1 expression space with tuples
-   [ ] Implement Generics
-   [ ] Implement Interfaces
-   [ ] Implement closures
-   [ ] Add a smart pointer system

#### Code Generation

-   [ ] Check all types match

### Future Reminders

-   Will need test to check for error on line 179 syntax_analyser.cpp when other uses of () implemented
-   Get people to rigorously test syntax and try to cause errors
-   Remember current last item in AST always returned
-   Remember there is no null
