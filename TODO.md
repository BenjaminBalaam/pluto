### Bugs

### Small Changes

-   [ ] Add order of operations rules (and fix tests accordingly)
-   [ ] Some AnalyseSyntax calls (such as for operations) need the previous return tokens to be passed to them
-   [ ] Redo assignment and declaration of variables
-   [ ] Make semicolons compulsory
-   [ ] Allow user to end assignment or function definitions with no body with a semicolon

-   [ ] Create tests for syntax_analyser for when AnalyseSyntax produces no AST (invalid token etc) including recursively (can only be done when all structures implemented)

### Features

-   [ ] Allow multi-assignments in variable assigning
-   [ ] Implement Templates

### Future Reminders

-   Will need test to check for error on line 179 syntax_analyser.cpp when other uses of () implemented
