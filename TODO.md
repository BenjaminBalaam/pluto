### Bugs

### Small Changes

-   [ ] Maybe rename AssignVariable

### Features

-   [ ] Add increment and decrement operators
-   [ ] Add tertiary operator
-   [ ] Bitwise Binary Operators
-   [ ] Allow multi-assignments in variable assigning
-   [ ] Allow entering mutliple expressions into a 1 expression space with tuples
-   [ ] Implement Templates
-   [ ] Implement Interfaces (maybe rename)
-   [ ] Add a smart pointer system

#### Semantics Analyser

-   [ ] Check and remove semicolons
-   [ ] Check all types match
-   [ ] Check all statements are valid (not qualifiers on their own etc)
-   [ ] statements in right context (returns in functions etc)

### Future Reminders

-   Will need test to check for error on line 179 syntax_analyser.cpp when other uses of () implemented
-   Get people to rigorously test syntax and try to cause errors
