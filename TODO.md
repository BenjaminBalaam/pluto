### Bugs

### Small Changes

-   [ ] Should constructors be the class name
-   [ ] Add return type checking on function calls and instancing classes
-   [ ] Should "this" be a member of a class instance
-   [ ] Should integer / do the same as $ or create a float and should float have integer div and modulo operators
-   [ ] In semantics analyser make sure no default arguments before parameters without default arguments
-   [ ] Change function definitions because void types exist
-   [ ] Decide if you can pre-declare variables
-   [ ] Allow using () in operations
-   [ ] Allow \* and \*\* in function definitions
-   [ ] Process generics in types

### Features

-   [ ] Create tests for interpreters
-   [ ] Add interfaces
-   [ ] Allow implicit casting between types
-   [ ] Change calling a function into a () operator a member accessing into a . operator
-   [ ] Use qualifiers in interpreter
-   [ ] Add increment and decrement operators
-   [ ] Add tertiary operator
-   [ ] Bitwise Binary Operators
-   [ ] Allow larger and smaller integers and floats
-   [ ] Allow multi-assignments in variable assigning
-   [ ] Allow entering mutliple expressions into a 1 expression space with tuples
-   [ ] Allow entering an argument name when calling a function
-   [ ] Allow qualifiers in function definitions
-   [ ] Implement Generics
-   [ ] Implement Interfaces
-   [ ] Implement closures
-   [ ] Add a smart pointer system

#### Code Generation

-   [ ] Check all types match

### Future Reminders

-   Will need test to check for error on line 179 syntax_analyser.cpp when other uses of () implemented
-   Get people to rigorously test syntax and try to cause errors
-   Remember current last item in AST always returned
-   Remember there is no null
